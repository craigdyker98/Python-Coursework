Computer Inventory System

This project is a Python-based computer inventory system designed to manage and track computer assets efficiently. It enables users to record, update, and organize hardware and software details in a streamlined manner, providing a reliable solution for asset management.

Data Analysis and Visualization

Separate from the inventory system, this project also includes a data analysis module that leverages pandas and numpy for numerical analysis, and matplotlib for visualization. This part of the project focuses on analyzing datasets, generating statistical insights, and visualizing data trends through various types of graphs and charts.
